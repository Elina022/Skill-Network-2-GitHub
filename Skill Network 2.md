# My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio

 My name is **Elina Rzayeva**.
        I currently work as an accountant.

*I am interested in learning data science because it is an in-demand, modern and multi-profile field where you can explore your knowledge in mathematics, information technologies and business strategies. Having specific and sufficient knowledge in this field can lead you also to rising career path. Moreover, as person grows in education, it feels like you are in the same wave as modern world in which you are not useless.Therefore, you obtain self-confidence through which your self esteem rises.*

### In below i will introduce a simple mathematical calculations


```python
print ("40 + 10 = 50")
```

    40 + 10 = 50


1. 15 + 5 = 20
  - 12 + 8 = 20
2. 20 + 5 = 25
  - 25 = 12 = 13
3. 25 + 5 = 30
  - 21 + 9 = 30
